## The topic

There is a lot of talking going on about migrants in European media and politics. But instead of raising awareness for the problems migrants are facing in their home countries, stereotypes and generalizations prevail. Migrants are increasingly perceived as a huge homogeneous wave of always the same people that are flooding Europe. We started this project to focus on the individuals behind the process, their stories, views, motivations, beliefs. Instead of categorizing people as migrants this project aims to the multicategorization of human beings.

## How do we do that?

In our town Cesena we organize intercultural dinners and events in public spaces. Migrants and locals are bringing food and eat it together. During those events we collect the recipes and let people tell their stories while we film them. We upload the recipe connected to the story of the chef on this website. 

## Spread the word

We want to encourage other cities to join us and all together improve integration of migrants in Europe. Migrants living here, students, locals, everyone - this website is open to your contributions.
